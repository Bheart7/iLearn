                  <p class='main__description' align='justify'>
                    The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a
                    material.Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons.This phenomenon is commonly studied in
                    electronic
                    physics and in fields of chemistry such as quantum chemistry and electrochemistry.According to classical
                    electromagnetic
                    theory, the photoelectric effect can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron.From this
                    perspective, an alteration in the intensity of light induces changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted
                    from
                    the metal.According to this theory, a sufficiently dim light is expected to show a time lag between the initial
                    shining
                    of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron.But the experimental results did not correlate with either
                    of
                    the two predictions made by classical theory.

                  <p class='main__description' align='justify'>
                    What is meant by the phrase “black body” radiation? The point is that the radiation from a heated body depends to some
                    extent on the body being heated. To see this most easily, let’s back up momentarily and consider how different materials
                    absorb radiation. Some, like glass, seem to absorb light hardly at all—the light goes right through. For a shiny
                    metallic surface, the light isn’t absorbed either, it gets reflected. For a black material like soot, light and heat are
                    almost completely absorbed, and the material gets warm. How can we understand these different behaviors in terms of
                    light as an electromagnetic wave interacting with charges in the material, causing these charges to oscillate and absorb
                    energy from the radiation? In the case of glass, evidently this doesn’t happen, at least not much.

                  <p class='main__description' align='justify'>
                    As a so-called "Theory of Everything" candidate, string theory aims to address various theoretical conundrums; the most
                    fundamental of which is how gravity works for tiny objects like electrons and photons. General relativity describes
                    gravity as a reaction of large objects, like planets, to curved regions of space, but theoretical physicists think
                    gravity should ultimately behave more like magnetism — fridge magnets stick because their particles are swapping photons
                    with fridge particles. Of the four forces in nature, only gravity lacks this description from the perspective of small
                    particles. Theorists can predict what a gravity particle should look like, but when they try to calculate what happens
                    when two "gravitons" smash together, they get an infinite amount of energy packed into a small space — a sure sign that
                    the math is missing something.
